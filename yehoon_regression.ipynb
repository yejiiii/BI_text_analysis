The reaction to this observation was the ruination of her career, and the beginning of his status as a pariah among most newsmen.  This book is used to add more ammo to the controversy.That the journalists who so eagerly pry into other peoples lives and business should be reluctant to be examined is hardly surprising.  Almost no one really wants to have his life or business dissected by Mike Wallace not even Dan Rather.  Some facts in this book are really potent such as the survey results which show how the average journalist and the average American are often vastly at odds.  Other chapters highlight different stories that TV news has covered and the analysis that Goldberg has made to point out the liberal bias.  His main theme is that while there is no conspiracy of the left, the fact is that most reporters are liberal but fewer still will admit it.There is some sound reasoning behind this book.  Sadly in execution, it doesn't come off as well as it could.  Goldberg has one argument in all the years he worked closely with Dan Rather (according to him) and yet it seems like all they did was fight.  Why ?  because Goldberg replays that one argument about 5 or 6 times in the book.  Much of the material that is thought provoking the first time around is pretty stale after the third or fourth reading. He kindly reprints the editorial that started the whole furor, too bad this was at the end of the book because the entire first chapter is just a rehash of that argument.  Too often Goldberg is reduced sounding like the bitter vindictive perso 93184\n"

I've heard of Ella James but had not yet read any of her work, and given the fact that I haven't read any YA lately, I was ready to give it a go.The book did start out a little choppy. We open with the heroine and her friends at a sleepover waking up and talking about going to play paintball and who was going to shoot who in the nuts for being a cheater. Funny, but for someone like me who doesn't do well with names, it was a little hard to follow. Thankfully, that little hiccup was short lived. Within a few pages I was hooked.The heroine, Milo, has continued a deer tagging project for her recently deceased father and accidentally shoots a boy with a tranq gun. But she swears he wasn't there, then there was a flash of light, a power surge, and he was there. In a tuxedo. I have to admit, that part cracked me up.The boy, whom she dubs Nick, has no memory whatsoever and Milo decides she needs to help him remember who he is. When the DoD shows up at her door and weird things start happening, Milo and Nick end up running for their lives.This one was a page turner! The action is super fast, and the dialogue easy to read. The characters were deep without being too angsty or self-absorbed as can be the case for some YA PNR. This one though, I thought was absolutely a great read and I'm eager to read book 2 since I'm not standing on the edge of a cliff. Or is it hanging?\"},\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Death is but a Dream is the first book under the mythology genre I have read, which even I am surprised at as I was fascinated by Greek Gods and their lore when I was younger. Erin Hayes is able to tell her story carefully, informing her reader fully of the Gods and their individual roles, without patronizing anybody who has prior knowledge of the Greek myths.One of the reasons I enjoyed Death is but a Dream so much is the way in which Erin Hayes is able to animate characters who are only known in stories 1000s of years old. I particularly liked her portrayal of Hades,&#34; Hades was middle-aged, dressed in a fine, $5,000 Giorgio Armani suit. He had a stylish haircut for someone of his age, peppering from a dark brown to a light grey at his temples. He looked like he was the CEO of a big company, which I was expecting. I just wasn't expecting him to be smiling at me, or to look so . . . happy.&#34;Callie is in the Underworld after being run over by a bus, saving a young girl. Though technically on earth she is in a coma Hades needs her detective skills to find out who is trying to assassinate his son, Plutus, the God of Wealth.Erin Hayes builds a layered plot and the perpetrator is difficult to determine, with Callie even questioning if Plutus has motive to arrange his own murder.With Aphrodite, goddess of love appearing in the story it is only fair to assume some romance amongst the mystery. However, though Plutus is the God of Wealth and the son of one of the most powerful of the Greek Gods, he is lacking in confidence, and has his own fixations.Callie is obsessed with her work and whilst in the Underworld allows Plutus' case to overwhelm her, having little time for other activities. The time Callie and Plutus spend together can often be awkward or even humorous, like showing a Greek God how to eat his first McDonalds!Death is but a Dream was a new genre of story-telling for me but I loved every moment of this book. Erin Hayes' ideas were fresh and I hope she continues Callie and Plutus' story in a sequel.A must read!I received this as a review copy, but this has had no influence on my opinion.\"},\n",
